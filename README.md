# BANCHA iOS App

Bancha is an Open-source CMS. We are currently working hard to implement an iOS App that dialogs with Bancha APIs, so you can manage every Bancha powered website.

Base framework: **IOSBoilerplate**
Currently not using ARC (Automatic reference counting) due to **JSONKit** lack of support.

Based on Bancha Open-Source CMS project by Nicholas Valbusa
